Deformation format
==================

This repository holds information and utilities for the JSON/GeoTIFF binary
deformation model format.  This format is a general purpose format designed 
for encoding deformation models as multiple nested grids.  

The specification is described in [doc/DeformationModelFormat.pdf](https://github.com/linz/deformation-model-format/blob/master/doc/GriddedDeformationModelProposal.pdf).  
This is produced from on an online [source document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wiyrAmzqh8MZlzHSp3wf594Ob_M1LeFtDA5swuzvLZY).

The contents of this repository are currently under development.
